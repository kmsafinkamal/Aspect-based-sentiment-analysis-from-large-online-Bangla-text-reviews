Abstractâ€”Aspect-based sentiment analysis categorizes 
opinions within a text, aiding businesses in understanding 
detailed customer feedback. For Bangla, spoken by millions, this 
analysis is essential due to the surge in online reviews. 
Challenges include complex grammar, limited annotated data, 
and specific linguistic nuances. To tackle these, we employed 
enhanced data pre-processing, TF-IDF transformation, and 
machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support 
Vector Machines, and Random Forest. Our process involved 
reading and pre-processing data, converting ratings to 
sentiment labels, exploratory data analysis, and TF-IDF for text 
feature engineering. The trained models yielded highly accurate 
sentiment classifications for both general and specific aspects. 
The RF model has achieved almost 91% accuracy. The results 
suggest our approach is viable for real-world applications
